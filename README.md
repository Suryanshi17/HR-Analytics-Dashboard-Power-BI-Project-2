I am uploading my Power BI Project 2 files here in this repository.

Title - HR Analytics Dashboard

This project explores employee attrition trends across various demographics and job roles, providing HR teams with powerful insights to improve retention strategies and increase workplace efficiency. I’ve transformed raw HR data into an interactive and comprehensive dashboard that supports data-driven decision-making at every level.

 The Key Insights are as follows as- 

1. "Analysis of Attrition by Age" revealed that the age groups 26-35 and 18-25 are experiencing the highest employee turnover. This indicates that younger employees may require more tailored retention efforts. 

2. "Salary slab analysis" showed that employees earning below ₹5K tend to leave the company at higher rates, emphasizing the need for competitive salary structures to improve retention. 

3. "Job role-based analysis" pointed out that roles like Laboratory Technician and Sales Executive have significantly higher attrition rates, suggesting the need for targeted initiatives to improve job satisfaction in these departments. 

4. "Educational background analysis" revealed that employees with degrees in Life Sciences and Medical fields are leaving at higher rates than those from Human Resources, hinting at possible mismatches between employee expectations and the work environment.

5. "Tenure-based analysis" indicated that employees with less than 2 years of service are leaving more frequently than long-serving employees, highlighting the need to strengthen onboarding and early-stage support for new hires.
